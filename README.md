## Singleplayer-Multiplayer Tic Tac Toe Game

This project is part of [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard) JavaScript chapter in the Fullstack JavaScript path. The project features:

* Singleplayer and Multiplayer modes.

* The Singleplayer mode is a match between the player and the computer. It uses a Minimax algorithm (coded from scratch in JavaScript) to find the optimal play in every round.

* The Multiplayer mode is a standard player .vs. player game.

I studied the Minimax algorithm from [CS50AI](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2024/) in week 0. While they use Python in the course, the concepts carry over to any language.

The result of the game is declared below the board.
